<p>
With the goal of having C++ be the only language one needs to learn, this 
repo supplies a single header file (cs.h) that embeds a 
dynamically-typed scripting language inside C++.  
For lack of a better name, it's called C++ Script (CS).
CS can be used for one-off scripts as well as more complicated programs
that contain a mixture of dynamically-typed and statically-typed code.
